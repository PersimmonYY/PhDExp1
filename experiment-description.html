    <h1>Description of the Experiment</h1>

    <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>

    <p>My name is <a href="https://www.dtu.dk/english/person/shixiang-yan?id=164757&entity=profile">Shixiang Yan</a>, and I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.healthtech.dtu.dk/research/research-sections/section-hearing-systems">Hearing Systems Section</a> from Danmarks Tekniske Universitet (DTU). I am inviting you to participate in an experiment for my current project as you are registered in our section's database and meet the requirements for this study.</p>

    <p>This experiment consists of two sessions. Below is an explanation of each session to give you a general understanding of the experiment. We will also hold an information meeting before each session, where I will provide more details.</p>

    <h2>1. Session 1: Audiological Tests</h2>

    <p>In this session You will wear headphones and complete a series of hearing tests in our listening room with support from our Danish audiologist. These tests will assess your hearing abilities from different perspectives:</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Test</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Loudness Scaling Test</td>
            <td>Measures how loud sounds seem to you at different levels.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Hearing-in-Noise Test</td>
            <td>Tests how well you can hear and understand speech in noisy environments.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Binaural Hearing Test</td>
            <td>Checks how well your ears work together to process sound.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Pitch and Timing Test</td>
            <td>Measures your ability to detect differences in pitch and timing between sounds.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sound Clarity Test</td>
            <td>Evaluates how clearly you can hear detailed patterns in sounds.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Audiogram Test</td>
            <td>Measures your hearing ability across a range of frequencies.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Duration</strong>: Approximately 1.5 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Timeframe</strong>: November 28, 2024 (Thursday) to December 19, 2024 (Thursday).</li>
        <li><strong>Location</strong>: DTU Sundhedsteknologi, Building 354, 2800 Kgs. Lyngby. (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/AzpSnHLZL7vfVHNn8">Google Maps</a>)</li>

    <h2>2. Session 2: Conversational Experiment</h2>

    <p>This session consists of four blocks, each containing approximately 20 to 25 trials. In each trial, you and two other native Danish participants will engage in a discussion about a general knowledge question while background noise is played through several speakers. For example, a question might be: "Which city has more tourists each year: Paris or Madrid?"</p>

    <p>The session will take place in our conversational lab, where you and the other participants will be seated as shown in the figure below. During the experiment, We will track your head and eye movements using lightweight tracking glasses and record your discussions for analysis.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Duration</strong>: Approximately 3 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Timeframe</strong>: Starting from mid-December 2024 to March 2025</li>
        <li><strong>Location</strong>: DTU Sundhedsteknologi, Building 352, 2800 Kgs. Lyngby. (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/wKDtFQE5DYGga7t16">Google Maps</a>)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you are interested in participating, please reply to this email with a few suggested days and times for <strong>Session 1 (Audiological Tests)</strong>. We kindly recommend that you provide as many available options as possible, as this will greatly help us in scheduling the test.</p>

    <p>The schedule for Session 2 (Conversational Experiment) will be arranged later, as we need to determine your auditory profile based on the test results from session 1 and match you with other participants.</p>

    <p>Your participation will greatly contribute to advancing research on hearing and communication in complex environments. We appreciate your interest and support!</p>

    <p>Best regards,<br>Shixiang Yan</p>
